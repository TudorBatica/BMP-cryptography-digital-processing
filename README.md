# BMP-cryptography-digital-processing
Developed using C, this project consists of 2 parts.  
The first part is cryptography related, in particular encrypting and decrypting a Bitmap.  
The second part is a template matching algorithm used for detecting digits on a Bitmap.

## Motivation
This project was developed during a Procedural Programming course I took in my first year studying Computer Science at the University of Bucharest.

## How do I use it?
