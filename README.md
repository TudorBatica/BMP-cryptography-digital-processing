# BMP-cryptography-digital-processing
Developed using C, this project consists of 2 parts.  
The first part is cryptography related, in particular encrypting and decrypting a Bitmap.  
The second part is a template matching algorithm used for detecting digits on a Bitmap.

## Motivation
This project was developed during a Procedural Programming course I took in my first year studying Computer Science at the University of Bucharest.

## How do I use it?
Simply copy the main.c source file and the BMP images. Then, compile and run the program.  
If you want to encrypt another BMP or if you want to test the template matching algorithm on another bitmap, place the BMP in the same directory as the main.c source file and use its name when calling the functions in the main function.
